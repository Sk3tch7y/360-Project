System Requirements:

    MAJOR (Foundational):
        
        - Responsive design philosophy. (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)
        - Error handling. (bad navigation)
    

    MINOR (Additional):
        - Activity by date.
        - Alerts on page changes.
        - Styling flourishes.
        - Responsive layout for mobile.
        - Tracking comment history from a userâ€™s perspective.

        - Accessibility. (Alt text for images, screen reader support?)
        
User Requirements:

    
        MINOR:
            - (Maybe) Allow Forum managers to "Pin" posts so that they are seen first when the forum is viewed.
            - AJAX posts marked as threads, so users may interact with each other live.
            - Collapsable threads.

            - Show User login state through manipulation of UI elements
