# Testing
    As A Group we decided that we would do manual testing, and as such have tried to test every edge case as weve built our functions
    our testing process can be found in our Error Handling and Validation Document

# Our Favorite Features
    Our Team believes we deserve the highest possible grade, as not only are all of our sites abilities fully functional, but we also took great consideration for scalability and efficiency. Our site doesnt store any posts or images in the database, allowing us to easily scale and implement new features for our users to edit their own posts and such. The AJAX Adam implemented also loads posts progressivly, stopping the server from overserving a client, and stopping a clients machine from being flooded as the posts database and comments database grows. We were also Extremely Proud of our mobile site design and its implementation of many user friendly design philosophies 
    Below is a list of all our favorite features for our users

## AJAX Post and comment fetching
    Our AJAX Post fetching Uses a last fetched time and a scroll detector to load new posts as the user scrolls, allowing them to keep viewing posts without being interupted
    The last fetch time is used to get new comments/posts without refreshing the page, or placing them near the top of the page away from the users view.
    This serves to minimize the client and Server resources for loading posts and comments, as it only loads enough for the user to view at one time. This also keeps all feeds 'Live' in that the user never needs to refresh to see the newest posts 

## Mobile site
    Our Mobile Site is awesome, looking nearly like a full webapp, with pop up menus and proper styling
    What more needs to be said? 


## Search and analysis for topics/items
    Posts are searchable by using the titles, and can be filtered while searched
## Hot threads/hot item tracking
    Items can be searched based on the number of promos in a way to find hot/popular items

## Visual display of updates, etc (site usage charts, etc)
    The site Flashes the home button to alert the user to new posts available in the feed

## Activity by date
    the site sorts comments/posts by date automatically and the 

## Tracking (including utilizing tracking API or your own with visualization tools)
    We did not utilize an external tracking API, but we did implement member tracking for communities in order to best understand usage

## Collapsible items/treads without page reloading
    comment sections are collapsed back into the post after clicking the close button

## Alerts on page changes
    The server alerts the client on changes in the feed by flashing the home button

## Admin view reports on usage (with filtering)
    Admin can view and delete any activity on the site, so they can use the forums page to sort and view usage, there are no specific reports as we did not know what we would be reporting on

## Styling flourishes
    Styling is insanely cool and awesome, I mean look at the mobile site. Clearly the best

## Responsive layout for mobile
    Our site is completely compatible with mobile. having its own dedicated site design but the responsiveness doesnt stop there. The site can easily be resized to fit any screen size or browser size without a hitch

## Tracking comment history from a userâ€™s perspective
    Users can view any of their posts/comments from their profile page

## Accessibility
    The site is properly Setup for Landmark roles for screen readers, and the usage of user titles helps to describe content for said posts, allowing screen readers to scrape posts semi consistently. there could be some improvements as we did not have the full time to experiment with screen readers but we gave it a good effort I think. We also used a bright and highly contrasting color pallete to improve usage for our color blind users
