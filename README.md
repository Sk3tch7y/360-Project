Project Deliverables:

Terms:

    - Forum admin is referred to as FAdmin
    - Site admin is referred to as SAdmin
    - User refers to any client acting outside of the

System:
    MAJOR:

        - Hand-styled layout with contextual menus (i.e. when a user has logged on to the site, menus reflect the change). 
        - 2 or 3-column layout using appropriate design principles (i.e. highlighting nav links when hovered over, etc) responsive design
        - Form validation with JavaScript
        - Server-side scripting with PHP
        - Data storage in MySQL
        - Appropriate security for data
        - Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)
        - Responsive design philosophy (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)
        - AJAX (or similar) utilization for asynchronous updates (meaning that if a discussion thread is updated, another user who is viewing the same thread will not have to refresh the page to see the update)
        - User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in a database
        - Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display
        - Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. users can determine where they are in threads)
        - Error handling (bad navigation)
        - Users can register
        - Registration determines user interactions, and users may view site content without registration

        - Allow Users to comment on posts

    MINOR:

        - Allow Forum managers to "Pin" posts so that they are seen first when the forum is viewed
        - AJAX posts marked as threads, so users may interact with each other live
        - collapsable threads

    MINOR:
